I am usually satisfied with writing as I write, and with my writing as I write it. However, I am rarely happy with things that I have written, and almost always reluctant to begin writing again. *Ergo*, none of the posts here are final, and so they bear version numbers. The version numbers are prefixed with `v-`, and they follow the guidelines of [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) insofar as semantic versioning makes sense for non-technical documents. I will be sure to increment the version number with each edit, but whether the change was major, a minor, or a patch will be a depend on my rough estimate of the damage done. The posts here are also backed by git, and the repo lives at [oncemoreification/argumentum-v](https://github.com/oncemoreification/argumentum-v) on Github.

`v-0.1.1`
