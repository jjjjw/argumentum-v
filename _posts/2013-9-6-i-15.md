title: Failure, the Winning Parts

Failure is interesting, conceptually interesting, because it always already inheres a logical negation. Failure is many things, but it cannot but be not success, no matter how success is defined. Therefore a good failure is essentially two things at once, its own moment, and the repetition of a not success. The inverse cannot be said about success, whose measure is positively defined.
