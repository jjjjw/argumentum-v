I have been personally fascinated for some time by the essay *It's raining (somewhere)* by François Recanati. At first my fascination was the symptom of a type of culture shock. The essay expends all of its efforts on the analysis of a single modicum of language, the simple sentence "It's raining". The benefits of this approach I thought I understood, an argument confined to a rigid and concrete scope could better succeed at grounding its own formalization. The "wow" was because it was the first time that I had fully encountered such a microscopic style of philosophy and it seemed obsessive and insane. Previously I had mostly read world consuming salvos in the Hegelian vein or existentialist poetics in the anti-Hegelian vein.

These days I have read enough of the Anglo-Saxon Analytic school to find its obsession and madness just as palatable as the obsession and madness of German Idealism with its grand metaphysical works, yet my fascination with *It's raining (somewhere)* persists. I think I can account for this personal obsession in philosophical rather than biographical terms.

Recanati's take on the sentence "It's raining" is unique among his peers. The sentence, he claims, implies a place and yet this implicature is not a component of the sentence itself. It could be the case that "It's raining" is a fragment, the sentence could require a place to be provided, but this is not linguistically necessitated. The sentence then has meaning that exceeds its semantic construction.

"According to my proposal, the sentence ‘it is raining’ means something very simple and very close to the surface: that a rain event is taking place, or (equivalently) that there is rain. No place is mentioned by the sentence as the place where that event occurs. Of course there must be such a place : an event can only occur at a particular place (and a particular time). This is a metaphysical fact about events, which holds whether the event is a raining event or a dancing event or a kissing event."

-Recanati, François. "It's raining (somewhere)." Linguistics and Philosophy. 30 (2007): 129 (6). Print.

What is amazing here is that without ever departing from the brilliantly simple, Recanati's argument arrives at a sublime metaphysical vista. Arising from an elementary unit of English is a "(somewhere)", an unspecified place that is a logically required stopgap. Hinted at is an openness, as though the rain refused to sign the contract that would bind it to a particular patch of Earth. My thesis then is that my fascination with Recanati's essay stems from its beautiful combination of the diminutive and contingent with the unbounded and untamed (somewhere).
