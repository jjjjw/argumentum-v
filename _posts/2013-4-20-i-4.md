Recanati's take on the sentence "It's raining" is unique among his peers:

"According to my proposal, the sentence ‘it is raining’ means something very simple and very close to the surface: that a rain event is taking place, or (equivalently) that there is rain."

-Recanati, François. "It's raining (somewhere)." Linguistics and Philosophy. 30 (2007): 129 (6). Print.

The sentence, he claims, implies a place (somewhere) and yet this implicature is not a component of the sentence as a raw succession of morphemes. It is as though a spiritual entity has been smuggled into the bare mechanics of the simple phrase, a meteorological *deus ex machina*. The place that is the site of the rain is strictly undetermined. As a side effect of this uncanny specification the encompassing world comes into view as a place in which rain is possible, as a deferred "(somewhere)", the world definitely exists but it isn't clear where.
