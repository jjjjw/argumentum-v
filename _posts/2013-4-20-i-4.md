Recanati's take on the sentence "It's raining" is unique among his peers. The sentence, he claims, implies a place (somewhere) and yet this implicature is not a component of the sentence as it stands. The sentence then has semantic meaning that exceeds its linguistic construction.

"According to my proposal, the sentence ‘it is raining’ means something very simple and very close to the surface: that a rain event is taking place, or (equivalently) that there is rain. No place is mentioned by the sentence as the place where that event occurs. Of course there must be such a place : an event can only occur at a particular place (and a particular time). This is a metaphysical fact about events, which holds whether the event is a raining event or a dancing event or a kissing event."
