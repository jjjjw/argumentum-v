“It is either the case that I am an amalgamation of my mental states, or the case that I am a disjunction of my mental states. I think, therefore I do not think, therefore I am a lucid thoughtlessness. Meanwhile, the odds remains utterly indifferent, arbitrary and undiminished. Possibility is merely chance.”

-Verbosium, Johannes. Collected Non-Zen Aphorisms. Pychon Press. 1985. 12. Print.

The greatest boon of rationality is irrationality, i.e., an insistence on the authentically random rather than some divine portension or the unfolding of a conspiratorial teleology whose objective is yet to be revealed. The consquence of the universal validity of rational laws is an irreducible absurdity, "lies, damn lies, and statistics". This opportunistic non-sense concludes that if "possibility is merely chance", then anything is probable.
