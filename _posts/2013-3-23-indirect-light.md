title: Indirect Light

The story of the Polar Children can be imbibed at personal discretion on the website of [Polar Inertia](http://www.3141592653589793238462.com/), but there is one phrase in particular that caught my attention:

>They saved me. Just like they'll save the others and all of you. It is under a shadow of obscurity that humans grow. Through pain and times of doubt their greatness revealed. When all is magnificent, and shining, humans lose sight. By the fall of night is true nature manifest. When all is stripped down, to its raw essence. We will bring about the ultimate obscurity. We will present this indirect light. Thus were the words of the Polar Children as we began our journey.

-Polar Inertia, *Indirect Light*.

For the Polar Children, redaction is a productive action. Subtraction exposes, and it impresses an ideal sheerness.

Yet night's gravity is matched by light's play, the carefree evaporation that flares in the midst of illumination. In this even slighter consolidation a vast romance is reflected:

>I dearly love the form of things. Particularly because forms make light visible, and light is a sublime substance. We only see light when it is reflected from the surfaces of forms and the diverse materials of which they are made. It is not only that light pervades the universe and is a kind of messenger of the histories and mysteries of time and space, but that it is aso the most intimate of phenomena, even as it is the most ephemeral. Maybe the two concepts are inexorably linked, sensuality and transience, intensity of experience and its brevity.

-Lebbeus Woods

There is a graph of this contrast, the files of the analysis have been passed from reader to reader by dead drop and chance. Each ray of light is a node, each darkness an edge. In their interleaving is the marrow of a tragic rotation, and linked to this infinite scorch is the human eye. A mesh of fantasy and physics, the wake of an apocalypse dragging its manicured sense across the boundaries of the known world. A flickering shadow at the heart of memory. An emptiness identical to speech, a shroud of flight.
