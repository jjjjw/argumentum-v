A popular aphorism of Marx goes, "History repeats itself, first as tragedy and second as farce." There is a graph of this contrast, a study conducted by Johannes Verbosium. The files of the analysis have been passed from reader to reader by dead drop and chance. Every tragedy is a node, and every comedy is an edge. In their interleaving is the marrow of a terrible rotation, the gravity of light, and linked to this infinite scorch is the human eye. A mesh of fantasy and physics, the wake of an apocalypse dragging its manicured sense across the boundaries of the known world. A flickering shadow at the heart of memory. An emptiness identical to speech, a shroud of flight.

Regardless, the graph by Verbosium was a document of linked quotations, a spiraling contraption of reference and reflection. I can reproduce a segment of it here:

"'We only see light when it is reflected from the surfaces of forms and the diverse materials of which they are made.'

-Lebbeus Woods

(pithy sentiment, introspection, and other soldered links)

'When all is magnificent, and shining, humans lose sight.'

-[Polar Inertia](http://www.3141592653589793238462.com/), *Indirect Light*."

The design choices of the author are not especially clear, and so the meaning of the study is left as an exercise for the reader.
