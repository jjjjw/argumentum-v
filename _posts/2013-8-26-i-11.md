*Non cogitamus, ergo nihil sumus*

-Miller Jr., Walter. A Canticle for Leibowitz. Eos, 2006. 302. Print.

The greatest boon of Cartesian rationality is irrationality:

“I think, therefore I do not think. Meanwhile, the odds remains utterly indifferent, arbitrary and undiminished. Possibility is merely chance.”

-Verbosium, Johannes. Collected Non-Zen Aphorisms. Pychon Press. 1985. 12. Print.
