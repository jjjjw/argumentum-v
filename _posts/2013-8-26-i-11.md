*Non cogitamus, ergo nihil sumus*

-Miller Jr., Walter. A Canticle for Leibowitz. Eos, 2006. 302. Print.

To linger on Walter Miller's aphorism is to stumble upon a pretty paradox. What at first seems to be a cynical view can actually be thought as something even gnarlyier. On a first pass, this latinate construction translates as "We don't think, therefore we don't exist", it is a simple inversion of the Cartesian *cogito*, where the singular "I" is moved to the plural "we" and the affirmative "ergo sum" becomes the negative "ergo nihil...". The sentiment here seems to be that via thoughtlessness we have forfeited our existence, we have fallen into nothingness. This extinction could be rendered literally by some apocalyptic catastrophe, or figuratively by some complacent enslavement and benightment. I.e. we could become either irradiated, brain-eating, zombies or cozy, brain-eaten, zombies. We mourn ourselves, we bemoan our fate, and we anonymously hide behind a plurality. Yet this anti-Cogito, this resignation, ensnares us.

To say *nihil sumus* is to nonetheless insist on something. In melancholy we hold on to melancholy itself.
