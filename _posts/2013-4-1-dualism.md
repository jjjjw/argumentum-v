title: Dualism
---

While symbols can be easily linked to one another, it is problematic to link them to the substances they purport to represent. There is a split between theory and practice, description and material, which can be emphatically confirmed by way of the Cartesian mind/body problem:

> Of course, the body *does* exist without the mind and presumably without the person, when the body is a corpse. This consideration, if accepted, would already show that a person and his body are distinct.(See David Wiggins, 'On Being at the Same Place at the Same Time', Philosophical Review, Vol. 77 (1968), pp. 90-5.)

-Kripke, Saul. Naming and Necessity. Paperback Edition. Blackwell Publishing, 1981. 144-145. Print.

In *On Being at the Same Place at the Same Time* Wiggins makes the following claim:

> The "is" of material constitution is not the "is" of identity.

*Id est*, we can make a clear distinction between composition and identification, but this does not imply that an identification stands over and against the sum of its parts. Even as an entity is the sum of its parts the entity is not to be confused with such a sum. This is because the identity function is made possible by abstraction from a given material condition. If something is equal to itself it cannot be otherwise, whereas a material condition could possibly be otherwise.

Yet while the identity function is deductive, the referent of an identification is not deduced. If this were the case then names would not require context or definition, they would somehow possess their meaning in their lexemes as is possible with conjunctions and portmanteaus.

Identification is a unique operation that is neither deductive nor inductive. An identification is a logical null value, it swallows predicates, and it depends on no features in the referent. Identification, then, is an invisible skin that sheaths the named world. When that skin is wounded we know not what bleeds before our senses because it bears no relation to the skin.

This leaves the mind/body divide as a matter for faith to settle. Whether a person vacates their body as soul or memory is arbitrary, the identity that wrapped the body was never tethered there.
