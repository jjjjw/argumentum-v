*What, if any, is the difference between recursion and repetition?*

"I see two paths to isomorphism, via recursion and via repetition."


-Verbosium, Johannes. Absurd Redundancy. Pychon Press, 1989. 10. Print

Speaking loosely, an isomorphic relation represents a structure common to unique objects even if they appear at different levels of abstraction or as discrete entities. To arrive at such a structure one needs a theory of translation, or perhaps simply a mechanism of (anti-)transformation, as in Verbosium's "pathways".

Crucially, such a pathway enables the subtle mediation that construes an identity. The formula required to prove identity is a redundant proposition, the logical statement, "A therefore A". With the repetition of 'A' and the recursion of its conclusion it is possible to prove what is most fundamental, that proof is possible, "Redundancy grounds deduction." (Verbosium, 17). Paradoxically, upon showing that "A therefore A" it is then evident that "A=A", 'A' was 'A' all along, and this equivalence is what made possible the initial "Leap to Nowhere", before such equivalence could be proven.
