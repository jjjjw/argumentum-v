"It is under a shadow of obscurity that humans grow. Through pain and times of doubt their greatness revealed. When all is magnificent, and shining, humans lose sight. By the fall of night is true nature manifest. When all is stripped down, to its raw essence."

- [Polar Inertia](http://www.3141592653589793238462.com/), *Indirect Light*.

For the Polar Children, subtraction is a productive action. The glare of night's redaction encapsulates an ideal sheerness. Yet night's gravity is matched by light's play, the carefree evaporation that flares in the midst of illumination. In this even slighter consolidation a vast romance is reflected:

"We only see light when it is reflected from the surfaces of forms and the diverse materials of which they are made. It is not only that light pervades the universe and is a kind of messenger of the histories and mysteries of time and space, but that it is aso the most intimate of phenomena, even as it is the most ephemeral."

-Lebbeus Woods

There is a graph of this contrast, a study conducted by Johannes Verbosium. The files of the analysis have been passed from reader to reader by dead drop and chance. Each ray of light is a node, each darkness an edge. In their interleaving is the marrow of a tragic rotation, and linked to this infinite scorch is the human eye. A mesh of fantasy and physics, the wake of an apocalypse dragging its manicured sense across the boundaries of the known world. A flickering shadow at the heart of memory. An emptiness identical to speech, a shroud of flight.
