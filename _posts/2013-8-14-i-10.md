"There is a paradox in the idea of transformation. If a transformation is deep-seated enough, it might also transform the very criteria by which we could identify it, thus making it unintelligible to us. But if it is intelligible, it might be because the transformation was not radical enough. If we can talk about the change then it is not full-blooded enough; but if it is full-blooded enough, it threatens to fall outside our comprehension. Change must presuppose continuity— a subject to whom the alteration occurs— if we are not to be left merely with two incommensurable states; but how can such continuity be compatible with revolutionary upheaval?"

-Eagleton, Terry. Figures of Dissent. Verso Books. 246. Print.

Such a transformation as Eagleton describes is a transformation of history itself, a change that alters and rewrites events in the past so that they can be compatible with the transformed present and its trajectory. There are words for this phenonemon; in German, *Nachträglichkeit*, in French, *après-coup*, words to describe the phenomenon of a defered event, a
n act that is performed in reverse. I argue that in English that we have a synonmous word, "retcon", a neologism that contracts "retroactive continuity" and is used to describe canonical changes in fictional universes.
