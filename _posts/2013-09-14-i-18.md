The strict problem of a postmodern position is that it posits a break, interruption, or discontinuity apropos the modern position. Yet this is merely to repeat the founding gesture of modernity, its novelty.

"And this is indeed no small or insignificant contradiction for postmodernity, which is unable to divest itself of the supreme value of innovation (despite the end of style and the death of the subject), if only because the museums and the art galleries can scarcely function without it. Thus, the new fetish of Difference continues to overlap the older one of the New, even if the two are not altogether coterminous."

-Frederick, Jameson. A Singular Modernity. Verso, 2012. 5. Print.
