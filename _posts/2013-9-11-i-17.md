title: Do Androids Engage in Dialectics?

*Abstract*

This essay aims to answer two questions.

1) What is meant by 'dialectics'? Here I will seek to define dialectics as a logical operation. I do not know if this is possible.

2) Are dialectics computable? Here I will consider various models of computation, e.g. Turing machines, finite-state automata, etc. and I will attempt to think the dialictic process within a mechanical mind. My hope is that this endeavour sheds light on the opposition between the *cogito* of subjectivity and the unconscious "it" of computed reasoning.

I think that both of these questions can be answered with reference to an account of language, specifically, the difference between natural and formal languages. Formal languages can be computed, and so the question is going to be if dialectics can "fit" into a formal language. To this end, what is meant by natural and formal languages will have to be defined. However, I do not think that the particular theoretical project here can be charted purely in abstract linguistic terms. My hope is to eventually formulate a testable, empirical hypothesis, that could demonstrate a dialectical machine.
