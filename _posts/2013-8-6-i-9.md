"It is either the case that I am an amalgamation of my mental states, or the case that I am a disjunction of my mental states."

-Verbosium, Johannes. Absurd Redundancy. Pychon Press, 1989. 67. Print.

The notion of a "mental state" mistakenly elides the Cartesian *cogito*, the reflexive thinking substance "*Cogito ergo sum*" (Descartes). Verbosium's either/or is a false dilemma. The proof of this is in the illustration of the fact that the *cogito* hinges on a crystalline reflexivity, rather than a mundane feature of thought. Nothing, in particular, is thought. There are no "mental states" needed to constitute an "I". Rather, the *cogito* is generative of its own being. Lacan captures this curious circumstance by articulating a delightfully twisted consequence:

"I think where I am not, therefore I am where I do not think..."

-Lacan

It is that case that thought, as its its own evidence, precedes the "I" even as it "is" the "I". Therefore, by the time that "I think", I have already thought, and as I "will think", I slip immediately into "have thought". Yet, if it was really me, I must have been in the flat predicate (*cogito*) even before the conclusion was drawn (*ergo sum*).
