*Cogito ergo sum*

-Descartes

What is sublime about the *cogito* is that it hinges on a crystalline reflexivity, rather than a mundane feature of thought. Nothing, in particular, is thought. There are no "mental states" needed to constitute an "I". Rather, the *cogito* is generative of its own being. Lacan captures this curious circumstance by articulating a delightfully twisted consequence:

"I think where I am not, therefore I am where I do not think..."

-Lacan

It is that case that thought, as its its own evidence, precedes the "I" even as it "is" the "I". Therefore, by the time that "I think", I have already thought, and as I "will think", I slip immediately into "have thought", the "I". Yet, if it was really me, I must have been in the flat predicate (*cogito*) even before the conclusion was drawn (*ergo sum*). The *cogito* then, is symptomatic of its own becoming.
