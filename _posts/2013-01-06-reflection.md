I am usually satisfied with writing as I write, and with my writing as I write it. However, I am rarely happy with things that I have written, and almost always reluctant to begin writing again. *Ergo*, I have gone back over all my previous posts and revised them. I plan to do this on an ongoing basis. As a result I think it makes sense to ditch the date associated with each post, as its "publishing date", and replace this bit of metadata with a simple numbered series.
